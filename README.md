## Architecture

MealPrep Me is built with a modular approach, organized around distinct feature areas:

* Frontend (Next.js): Pages and components are organized by functionality for clarity and reuse.

* Database (Supabase): Stores user information, hierarchical notes, and compiled code, while also supporting real-time updates.

* Styling (Shadcn/ui + Tailwind): Ensures a cohesive, theme-aware user interface.

* Custom Hooks & Contexts: Streamline the management of application state, user data, and theme preferences.

This structure enhances maintainability, supports isolated feature testing, and enforces a clean separation of concerns.

## Project Management
We used Figma ([mockup here](https://www.figma.com/design/34kaSJM9V8IHBJAV7wohMd/Comp426?node-id=2-287&t=I6Vzqogk3gwSAYMj-1)) to create interactive wireframes for our feature before developing and Github project boards to keep track of tickets' status. We followed Googleâ€™s code review guidelines as well as their limit on AI contributions to code (we estimate under 10% of our project includes AI generated code).
